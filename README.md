# Islandora SharedCanvas Manifest Generator

## Introduction

This module produces [SharedCanvas Manifest](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.0/#manifest) Islandora datastreams for [Islandora Book Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book) objects to be used by the [Mirador Bookreader](https://github.com/utlib/islandora_mirador_bookreader) module. 

This module development was supported by the The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for the [French Renaissance Paleography website] (https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/).

## Install
1. Clone this module into Drupal's module directory and enable.
3. Go to admin/islandora/tools/sc_manifest` and enter the URLs for the [IIIF Image API](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/) server and Fedora.

## Usage
There are two ways to generate manifests: Drush or individual Book Solution Pack object. Both generate a new datastream called **SC** in their target objects.
### Drush
On the command line, run the following drush command:
```
drush scgen PID_TO_REINDEX
```
where PID_TO_REINDEX is a single Book Solution Pack object.
Run the following to reindex the entire repository:
```
drush scgen FULL
```
### UI
Each Book Solution Pack object has a new **SC Manifest** option under **Manage** through the admin UI for each object. The option exists as a sub-menu item.

Clicking **Re-generate SC Manifest** will add a new SC datastream for the current object. Subsequent usage will refresh the datastream.
